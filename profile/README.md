Welcome to DroidsX!

# Who we are
The robot revolution already happened but only software engineers participated. The 100 million cloud robots in data centers are inaccessible to most of humanity. That's a scale superpwoer we want to unlock for everybody. We invite you to build show and tell robots with us so - that the rest of humanity can be exponential. 

Not only is it the right thing to do, but it is the safe thing to do. Droids should be owned and maintained with the community not monopolized by giant corporations. iRobot and Skynet are real dangers. No amount of siloed brilliance will avoid unintended consquences. We need anti-fragile ecosystems and that means building together as a community. We are smarter together with diverse ideas and modes of thinking providing a shared base of fail-safes, collision avoidance, machine learning, etc.

# What you can do
The projects in this repository will let you use your phone or XR device to teleoperate any robot. Coming xmas 2024 you will be able to show a robot how to do things like fold a t-shirt and then activate it with voice commands or Apple shortcuts.

We provide the following capabilities 100% open-source for you to use in your own projects:
* Droid Bodies - a growing set of robots you can 3d print and assemble alone along with motion drivers (many for under $1,000 or even $500)
* Droid Telekenesis - universal teleoperation using commodity cameras or XR devices, you can bring your own controller or get and use one of the supported controllers 
* Droid Head - a mini-computer with camera that controls your robot and provides built in camera support for Droid Telekensis
* Droid Mind - ML algorithms to learn from your "lessons"
* Droid Tutoring - use telekensis, head, mind, and a body to teach a robot to do work

# I Just Want to Train Robots
If you don't care to hack on your own to start and want to see what is possible you can buy a kit from us. 

1. Unbox and setup wifi.
2. Show and tell your task. 
3. Let your Droid sleep on it. 
4. Then watch it go to work!

If you don't share your data you can pay per task - but it's expensive. You may want to use your own GPU. If you do share we act as a hub to aggregate data for the community and the entire network will get ever smarter. 

Not only is it a better XP and better for the community, but you also will benefit financially from sharing data. We believe it's wrong for companies to get 100% of the value for data that you have provided. We hate "free" services with hidden costs and bias. Social media optimizing for outrage..? Yeah, free is never free. We want simple transparent relationships.

You should:
1. get compensated for helping the network
2. have the option to keep your data private and pay the network a premium to use our shared Droid Mind
3. have the option to use your own software 

We will provide community ownership opportunities and rewards in Q1 2025 (working on it!) and the early contributors will get the lion's share. We will also offer the alternatives mentioned above when you select your subscription. Just keep in mind depending on when you are reading this it may not all be released.
